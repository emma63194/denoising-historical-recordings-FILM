Adapt for old movie audio denoising with M3 optimization

Major Changes:
- Added M3 Metal GPU support for MacBook Air training
- Integrated multi-dataset training (AISHELL-3 + FSD50K + MusicNet)
- Adjusted SNR range from uniform(2,20) to uniform(10,25) dB
- Implemented adjustable denoising strength (0.0-1.0)
- Added comprehensive training documentation

Configuration:
- Created conf_prototype.yaml for M3-optimized settings
- batch_size=4, epochs=20, steps_per_epoch=200
- Validation dataset expanded to 628 files (6 speakers + sound + music)

Training History:
- Completed 4 training runs with progressive improvements
- Final model: val_MAE 0.156 (20 epochs, 6.25x data)

Documentation:
- Added TRAINING_SUMMARY.md with all 4 training experiments
- Added M3_GPU_GUIDE.md for Apple Silicon setup
- Added WHY_LOSS_CONVERGED.md for problem analysis
- Organized all docs in docs/ folder

Files cleaned:
- Removed training logs (*.log files)
- Added comprehensive .gitignore for large files
- Excluded .cache/ (2.4GB), experiments/ (30MB), outputs/ (540KB)
